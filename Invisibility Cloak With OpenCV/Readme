What is the project really about?

Like in the movie "Harry Potter" there was an invisibility cloak, I tried to recreate that.
Only the red color will get invisible and you will be seeing the background instead of any red object.

Logic: We are capturing the live feed of the person and we are breaking that feed into images, 
       basically frames.On those frames we will apply image segmentation to differentiate the 
       color of the object from rest of the image and we then super-impose the background image over there.
       So wherever the color of the cloth the background image is visible.
